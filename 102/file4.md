Structure Web Pages with HTML

# Class 4 notes

Today we learned how to construct a *wireframe*. This is a very rough structure that can be used to model various things after. it allows for a potential design for a website. I started mine drawing it by hand and then used mio to roughly build out what it was that I was going to try to do for my site. This is just a simple basic step.

We also started working with *HTML*. This is more heavily used to build out the site. After this is used to build the basic content of the page, we can use other future programs to fine tune it

## Things I would like to learn more about.

As with before, I really just need to do this a lot. It is difficult to get more time now, but as these sites become more familiar and the use of them becomes more understood, I find it becoming easier and more efficient. I would like to learn everything up to now more proficiently.
