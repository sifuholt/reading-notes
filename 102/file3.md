# Revisions and the Cloud

Today we learned about Git. It is a type of control system, offsite, that allows multiple developers from different areas to work on the same code. It will maintain the progress and allow access for all parties.

The biggest thing that we can do is ACP
Add
Commit
Push

The best practice to remember is to make sure that you are in the correct area and check "git status" frequently. This will insure that you are not making mistakes.

## Things I would like to know more about

I just need to do this process a lot so that I can get more proficient, but it would be nice to figure out a solid way to consistently do that.
