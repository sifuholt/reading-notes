Programming with Java Script

Class 7 notes

This is a very versatile tool that allows for several types of applications.
The order that the computer runs the text in the script is called control flow. It will start at the top and run to the bottom.
The only exception to this would be if there were loops that caused it to repeat a specified number of times.

if "()"
  else "()"

Use of "if" and "else" will prompt the user to type something in order to proceed.

A function is code that will execute an assigned task.

So,
let x = 5;
let y = 7;
let c = x * y;
 This would multiply them, and the (/) symbol would divide.

in Js we can use the (+) symbol to not only add numbers together, but if we assign different values to numbers and put them in ('') we can assign some other value to these. This would allow us to concatonate?, meaning add what is in the quotes together.

so, if
firstN = 'Ken';
lastN = 'Holt';
fullN = firstN + '' + lastN; which would give us Ken Holt. In order to get space in between the names we have to allot actual space for it. 



##Things I would like to learn more about.

I would like to become more efficient in this and the other material that lead up to this in order to become more proficient.
