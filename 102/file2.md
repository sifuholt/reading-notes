Class 2 Notes - The Coderâ€™s Computer

We discussed Text Editors, which are basic programs to create code. There are some that come installed on your computer, but they are not recommended.

We discussed Code Editors, which are interactive programs used to create code, they can help make it easier to understand. They have the ability to work wiht various coding languages which is helpful. Some great Code Editors are VSCode and NotePad++.

Terminal is another name for Cofmmand Line Interface, which is a way to navigate your copmuter. Some examples of this would be cd, to change directory, or ls, which shows you which directory you are in.

This is a way to navigate your computer through text-based commands (vs using a mouse and keyboard). You are given a prompt and type a respone. The terminal will produce a text response, and the cycle continues.

The big parts to understand here are the details. Every detail matters, and while there are many ways to figure it out one way, the various ways of utilizing tools are throughout. 

I would really like to just practice this more, the repetition of it will help me familiarize myself with what needs to be done...say in VS Code.
