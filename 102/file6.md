Activate web pages with JavaScript

# Class 6 notes

JavaScript, camelcase, is one of the programs that helps webpages do what it is that you are looking for them to do. It is used in creating as well as maintaining. I used Node.js to practice in. There are variables which can be called identifiers. 

Everything is case sensitive
Must begin with a letter


## Things I would like to learn more about
write more in Node.js and using it to create search functions.
