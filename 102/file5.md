Design Web pages with CSS

# Class 5 notes


CSS is cascading style sheets, and it allows many upgrades to the basic html site. We can add color and further design and structure what has already been created. There are many ways to implement this upgrade, but the most efficient, and the one I have used so far is to link a stylesheet that I have maintained and upgrade it.

We can change the font this way

We can change the color of the text

There are many resources on the web that will help us utilize these tools.

It is not recommended to use the Reset, but if it must be done because of the breaks, then it is there.


## Things I would like to learn more about

Seems like there is a lot with CSS, and it isn't going anywhere. More practice using the tools up to now and focusing on understanding the process.
