Operators and Loops

Class 8 notes

comparison operators do just that. They compare things and return data based on whether it is true or not.

an assignment operator assigns a specific value for comparison. Equal has a few meanings (=) versus (==) versus (===)

there are two types of loops, while and for.

the for loop has a specific response it is looking for and the while can continue if it is not set up properly.

##Things I would like to learn more about.

I have had such a fun time up to now. I just want to pratice this and make friends and learn more. I will get it. Loops! I want to learn loops!
