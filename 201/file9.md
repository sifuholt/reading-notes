Class 9 Notes


Why this matters to me.
  This is important and matters to me because it continues to help me with my journey in coding. These readings help me get a head start on what we will talk about in a few hours and as I continually build on previous knowledge I am able to slowly have some new material introduced.
  
  
HTML FORMS

1. Why are forms so important in web development?
  They are used for collecting data from users, which allows them to control a user interface.
  
2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
  Order it logically and only ask what is required.
  Present fields in a single column layout.
  Minimize the number of input fields.
  Match fields to the size of the input
  Place labels above the corresponding input fields

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
  <form> will define a HTML form for user inputs
  <input> to define input control
  <datalist> to specify a list of pre-defined options
  <fieldset> to define a group of related elements
  <keygen> to define a secure input
    
    

MORE Js

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
  Well, events are 'things' that happen to HTML elements. there are window, form, keyboard, mouse media...etc.

2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
  A string describing the name of the event to be handled first, then the listener object, either a function or an object implementing the interface.

3. Describe the event object. Why is the trget within the event object useful?
  It contains a number of properties that describethe event that occurred. The event target it the inner most nexted eleent that was targeted by the event.

4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
  Bubbling is first captured and handled by the innermost element, then propagated to outer elements. Capturing is first in the outermost element and propagated to the inner, basically the reverse.
    
    

THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT
  More of the same. This week and everything we have done up to now is getting better. I won't say easier, because it certainly isn't easy, but it does help me understand what is going to be needed...and rightly so. I would love to learn more, and I will. Just going through the motions helps a great deal.
