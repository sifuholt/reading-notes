Class 08 Notes

Why this matters to me.
  This matters to me because I get to build on some of what I have already learned and to expand a bit more. It matters because I want to be good at this and I really want to understand more so that I can get better.
  

CSS - FLEXBOX

  1. Flexbox is designed for one-dmimensional content. Explain what this means.
    It is a layout model that was deisgned to provide greater control over alignment and space distribution between items within a container. Being one dimensional, it only deals with layout in a single direction, meaning columns or rows, it works well for smaller layouts, like components.
    
  2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
    Cross axis will run perpendicular to the main axis, so if the main axis is set to row or row-reverse, the cross axis runs down the columns. If the main axis is column or column reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows.
    
  3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
    Performance issues. The use of flexvbox can increase the page loading time if you have a larger project. It is used to vertically align the flex items across the cross axis.
  
  
CSS Layout - FLEXBOX

  1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
    Flexbox is responsive and mobile-friendly. It contains margins of its content. Float would allow you to create layouts by floating the elements to the right or left. Flexbox allows you to create a layout by aligning items to a single axis.
    
  2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
      It is an additional tool that I can use. It would mean that I could have a central area that I focus on and what is in flexbox would go around it rather than my floating select elements in either horizontal direction.
      
      

THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
  
  I am going to work on implenenting this and just putting time in at the keys. I know that I need to balance what I am doing in here with a life and I think this will make the current project that I am working on easier, so I am stoked about that!
