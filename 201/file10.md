Class 10 Notes

Why this is important to me:
  This is important because I get to further solidify my path in this course.


Debugging Js


1. Name some key differences between a syntax error and a logic error.
  A syntax error occurs when we make a mistake in coding, a logic error is harder to find, a logic error is an unexpected output of the program
  
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
  There are too may errors from the past week. Usually I just look for the red lines because of use strict, but I still have to get it to run. I have not corrected them yet, I will ask for help tomorrow...well, later today.
  
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
  I need a positive outcome from lab this week. I have spent countless hours on what to do. I have looked at so many examples and am just getting confused with the direction to go. I can't keep up with the progress. Not to say that I can't do it, just that I need to see a way that has a positive end.

1. How would you describe the Js debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
  It will pause code execution wherever you insert it in the code. It functions as a breakpoint, pausing the execution.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.
  It helps to speed up the debugging process in a large program by allowing the execution to continue up to a desired point before debugging begins. More efficient.
  
3. What is the call stack?
  A stack data structure that stores information abut the active subroutines of a computer program.



Things I would like to know more about:
  Well, at this point I would like to know how to initiate some of this. As of now I have to see something else or follow, still, and it would be nice to be able to look at a blank screen and know where to start and how to say something that would be meaningful.
