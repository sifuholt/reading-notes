Class 06 Notes

Why this is important.
  This is important because it is building on what I have already learned and helps me just process through more of it and I get to see different ways to do things. I still need to work on balance.
  
  

MORE JavaScript

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
  In object oriented programming, data structure or objects are defined with their own properties or attributes. Each object can contain its own procedures or methods. Software is designed by using objects that interact with one another.
  
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
  Convenience, flexibility in declaration and less code during declaration.
  
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
  Objects represent things with characteristics or properties and arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable.
  
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object's property instead of dot notation.
  We must use bracket notation whenever we are acessing an object's property using a variable or when the property's key is a number or includes a symbol or is two words with a space.
  
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
  This is a string. 
  


Introduction to DOM

1. What is DOM?
  DOM is document object model
  
2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
  Dom is an interface that defines how the browser reads xml or html documents. JavaScript is allowed to manipulate structure and style. 



Things I would like to learn more about.
Same as before, just need time at the keys figuring this out and making mistakes to remember not to do in the future.
