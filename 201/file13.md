Class 13 Notes

Why this matters to me.
  This is important because it continues to build on what I have been learning and explores new options going forward.
  
  

Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
  If you use local storage you can keep users from using up your quota. It allows storage access for a documents origin.
  
2. What information should not be stored in local storage?
  Local storage should never be used for sensitive information such as passwords and personal information.

3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
  It is a property that allows Js sites and apps to save key value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. It can only store string data.



Things I would like to learn more about.
  Doing this daily and speaking to people and about it and learning. Just the same things that I need to do to get better.
