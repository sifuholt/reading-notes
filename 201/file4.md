Class 04 Notes

This matters to me because this is my path now. I am dedicated and eager to be part of this journey. It not only represents what I want to be part of at the completion, but the process as well. All of these pieces of knowledge build upon one another.


MORE HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
  An <a> element using the href attribute, a hypertext reference or target.
  
2. The href attribute contains what information?
  An attribute of an anchor tag. contains two componets. the URL and clickable text.
  
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
  Use meaningful text for links, do not capitalize all letters, avoud using URLs for link text, do not use the word link, no tooltips.


  
MORE CSS

1. What is meant by "normal flow"?
  Flow layout is the way that block and inline elements are displayed on a page before changes are made to the layout.
  
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
  Inline elements never start from a new line, they cover space as bounded by tags, block level elements covere space from left to right.
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
  Static positioning.
  
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
  Easy to learn, can easily position div pretty much anywhere.
  
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
  Absolute is relative to its block and fixed is relative to the viewport or browser window itself.
  


MORE JS

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
  A function declaration must have a function name, invocation is used to execute the function code.
  
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  An argument is the values that are declared within a function, and the variables that are defined when the function is declared is a parameter.


  
MISCELLANEOUS

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how the benefits could help your coding journey.
  More two heads are better than one. This has to be the best. The idea that two people, or more, are working towards the same goal, creates a balance that is unique. 
  The driver and the navigator. Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing. Definitely greater efficiency. Engaged collaboration..because none of us are alone.


THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
  Time at the keys. Again, this will be my continual response, and I mean it. It isn't that I want to know any one thing more than the next, I want to include everything that I can and learn for the sake of learning. All of this.
