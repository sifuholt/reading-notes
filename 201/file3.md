Class 3 Notes

Why This Matters To Me:
    Again, all of this is important because it continues to build on what I have learned up to now and I get to have a stronger foundation going into the newer, more nuanced things that make coding unique. The more details I understand and figure out how to implement the more efficient this will become
    
    
MORE HTML

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
  When you would like it to contain information where order should be emphasized, like a recipe.
  
2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
  list-style-position: outside.
  
3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?
  To create a list of related items in no particular order, this would be an unordered list. But to create a list of related items, in a specific order, this would be an ordered list.
  
4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
  One option would be to use the THML <ol> element to define an ordered list, we could use the html type attribute to define the numbering type. We could also use the HTML <li> to define the list item. 


MORE CSS

1. Describe the CSS properties of Margin and padding as charscters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: "The Box Model"?
  First there was Marvin the margin, the space around an element's border, then came Peter padding, the space between an element's border and the element's content. Together they control the space outside and inside of the element! In "The Box Model" we find Marvin and Peter working together to create a lovely environment while getting the job done. They would both provide a great background and surrounding and make "The Box Model" stand out!
  
2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
  Content edge - which is the top of where the main content would go.
  Padding edge - which would be the next level on the way to the middle.
  Border edge - which would be the level beneath that towards the margin.
  Margin edge - which would lead us to the edges of the margin of the whole thing.


MORE JS

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?
  The values in an array can be any type. They may contain values that are simple reals or integers or vectors or matrices or even other arrays.
  
2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? if not, why?
  Yes. Arrays can be any data type. These are a bunch of strings. The values stored can be accessed by running it in a terminal to see an order or list.
  
3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
  Addition assignment - x+=f() - addition
  Subrraction assignment - x-=f() - subtraction
  Multiplication assignment - x*=f() - multiplication
  Division assignment - x/=f() - division
  Modulus assignment - x%=f() - modulus
  
4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
  It wouldn't be anything because the last expression is a string. In order for this to work they would have to be numbers.
  
5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
  I have a cat. If my cat is good when I am coding, it will lay by my side and is not hungry. If my cat is bad when I am coding then it will jump on my lap. If my cat continues to jump on my lap while I am coding, then I will have to give her some food and put her outside the door!
  
6. Give an example of when a loop is useful in JavaScript.
  It depends on the loop, but they are useful if you would like to show a message multiple times. They can go on for a long time or a set number of iterations. An example would be if you wanted someone to be allowed a certain number of chances to do something.
  
  
  
THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
  
 All of this. Again, the repetition of each step is what is not only needed, but what I want to know more about. That will only come with time at the keys...and trying and failing and pushing and changing and growing. I would just like to continue to do exactly this.
