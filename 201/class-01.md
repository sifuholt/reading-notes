Prep work.

These topics matter because understanding the foundations of how this is all held together is important. This isn't the very beginning, but it is far enough back that if I can follow and implement this, what is to come will become a smoother transition. 


This is my poem.

I sat and read about HTTP,
This is definitely not easy for me.
An application protocol that is a form of computer speak,
The browser sends a request to the server, it can't be weak.
Files are then sent in data packets,
Weak it can't be, because people will hack-it.


There is actually an order to which component files are parsed. Initially a browser sends a request to a server for html files. Often these files contain "link" elements which reference external CSS stylesheets as well as a "script" element which reference external Javascript files. First the browser will parse the html file, which means that the browser will recognize the stylesheet and any references to "script". While it is doing this, it sends a request to the server for CSS files, "link", and Javascript files, "script", and then it creates an in-memory DOM tree from html, an in-memory CSSOM structure from CSS, then finally compiles and executes the Javascript, which has already been parsed. As this is all done, a visual representation of the site is displayed on the screen. This is how the user will be able to interact with the site.

Choosing an image is as easy as going to google images and looking for something you would like. It is polite to credit where you got the images from. There is also a license filter that can be used.

A string is a sequence of text, but it is enclosed in single quote marks
  example: let myName = 'Ken';
whereas, if you want to write a number, you do not need quotes
  example: let myNumber = 7;
  
A variable is a container that stores a value. It starts by declaring it with the word "let" followed by the name you give it. At the end, just place a semicolon. Variables can hold values that are different types of data. Variables are necessary to do pretty much anything in programming. If they couldn't change, that value of the variable that is, nothing dynamic would occur.



An html attribute is a language used to adjust behavior or display of the element. Attrributes are used to change size, color or functionality.

The anatomy of an html element is basically a head, body and a frameset.

The difference between article and section is that the when grouping sections of content or functionality, "article" is used for containing individual pieces of content.

The basic elements of a website with html elements would be a header, nav, section, article, aside, footer, details and summary.

Metadata is important because it searches for keywords and then compares it to organize. The more hits the keywords have the higher up the list it will be.

"Meta" tags are what provides information about the website.



The first step in designing a website is to have an idea. Then just map out what you want to accomplish, figure out how this site will help you reach the goal, and put in order what needs to be done. This is otherwise known as project ideation.

The most important question to answer is what is wanted to be accomplished.



H1 should be used over span because "span" has no semantic value.

H1 gives the text it wraps around a role.



server side generates new content on the server, and client side generates new content inside the browser.

To apply Javascript to an html page we use <script>.

  
  

##Things I would like to learn more about
  All of this!! I need to put in time doing this over and over and making errors and learning.
