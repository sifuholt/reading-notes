Class 02

Why this topic matters as related to what we are studying.
  This is important because it will help me better understand how to implement what it is that I need to do to become more successful and confident continuing to understand coding. 



More on HTML.

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
  Semantic elements really make it easier for the code to be understood, it makes the source code more readable.
  
2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
  There are six levels of headings as defined by html.

3. What are some uses for <sup> and <sub> elements?
  The sup element is a superscript and the sub element is a subscript. Only used to mark up typographical conventions that have specific meanings

4. When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide full expansion of the term?
  The <title> attribute can be used to give an expansion to <abbr> 

  
  
More on CSS
  
1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
  There are basically three ways that we can add CSS to our HTML.
    First is inline - by using the style attribute inside the elements.
    Second is internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.
    Third is external - by using a <link> element to link to an external file.
  
2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?
  Inline styles do not separate content from design, they are the same as embedded font.
  
3. Review the block of code below and answer the following:
  What is representing the selector?
    h2 represents the selector
  Which components are the CSS declarations?
    Everything between the curly brackets is considered a CSS declaration
  Which components are considered properties?
    In CSS, color, border, margin or font style

  
  
  More on Js
  
  1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
    This data type is known as a string.
  
  2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.
    Arithmetic, assignment, comparison or logical operators.
  
  3. Describe a real world problem you could solve with a function.
    multiplication - 
      function multiply(num1, num2) {
      let result = num1 * num2;
      return result;
      }
  (I have to give credit to the website we read for this examply, but multiplication, or division, or addition..etc can be solved)
  
  
  1. An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to __, then the code block will execute.
    An if statement checks a VALUE and if it evaluates to TRUE, then the code block will execute.
  
  2. What is the use of an 'else if'?
    This would be used if one condition is true and the other one is false.
  
  3. List 3 different types of comparison operators.
    Less than, greater than, and either less or equal or greater or equal to.
  
  4. What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?
    The && operator will return TRUE (when both operands are true) and the || will return FALSE (when both are false, but true in other examples)
  
  
  
  THINGS I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
    Like yesterday, I really like just going through the motions and learning how to apply all of this to creation. The repetition of process and the understanding of errors and my continuiing opportunity to learn from some truly amazing instructors in an environment that is completely motivational...yea, that is what I want to know more about. All this.
