Psychological Safety

What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
  Frame work as a learn problem, not an execution problem.
  Acknowledge your own fallibility.
  Model curiosity and ask lots of questions
  
Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to phychological safety.
  I worked for a company in California that sold credit card processing to business owners. Knowing what I had to do and wanting to just make the money really took its toll on me. Didn't do it for long that way.
  
What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
  Probably a great deal. Constantly feeling pressure to perform within someone else's idea of continual progression. It was frustrating to continually be told that if I couldn't produce what was wanted that there were any number of others that were ready to fill my shoes. If I was in a setting that concerned themselves with the psychological aspect of what was happening, not just to the bottom line, but globally and how we can scale to meet demands that will put us on a different scale for clients..yea, more productive staff. Not just because they make money..always a plus, but bigger eyes are required. 
  

Things I wold like to know more about.
  Well, I need time at the keys coding and figuring out the story I want to tell and how I want to paint it. I want to do well. I have good ideas.
