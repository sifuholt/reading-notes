Class 7 Notes

Why this matters to me:
  Moure building. More nuanced conversation about how to do what we will be doing in the future with web design and layout, more knowledge to pass on. This matters to me because it is more information that will help me become better at this.
  

DOMAIN MODELING

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
  We need domain modeling because it is a great tool for agile enterprise to carry out a common language and a fundamental structure important for the analysis of features and epics. it is defined and continuously refactored as enterprise knowledge about how the domain imporves and the system functionality ultimately evolves.



MORE HTML
1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
  Tables should not be used for layouts because they were originally intended to be used for presenting tabular data. They are hard for screen readers to parse, some of the content doesn't make sense when reading from left to right.
  
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table.
  header: defines content that should be considered the introductory information.
  nav: used for navigation links.
  main: contains the main content of the page.



INTRODUCING CONSTRUCTORS
1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
  A constructor is a method that executes automatically when creating an object instance. Some advantages to using them are that you can preset some attributes of the object when you instance it and perform other operations.
2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
  Objects created when using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object it affects the object entire script. Conversley if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made, that change wont' affect the object throughout the script.



OBJECT PROTOTYPES USING A CONSTRUCTOR
1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
   Prototypal inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add mehtods and properties in objects. it is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object.

  
THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT
  Just more of this. I want more time at the keys making mistakes and figuring it out. Speaking to others and getting new ideas.
