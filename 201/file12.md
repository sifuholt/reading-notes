Class 12 Notes

Why this is important.
  This is important because it helps me further understand how I have gotten to hear and what else I can do going forward.
  


JavaScript Canvas

1. What does canvas allow a developer to achieve?
  It allows you to draw 2D graphics using Js. It requires at least two attributes, width and height.

2. What is the importance of the closing canvas tag?
  Code with closing tags is much more readable and easy to follow. It is easier to visually inspect a page with well laid out markup.

3. Explain what the getContext method does.
  getContext returns a drawing context on the canvas or null if the context identifier is not supported, or the convas has already been set to a different context mode.
  
  

Chart.js Documentation

1. What is chart.js and how can it be brought into our project?
  We add a script that acquires the myChart canvas element and instantiates new chart with a desired configuration.

3. List 3 different chart types we can create using chart.js.
  Bar Graph, Column Chart, Line Graph, Dual Axis Chart, Pie Chart
  
  

Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js.

1. What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?
  Charts display more than a collection of individual values. they show the overall shape of our data.
  
2. How could chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?
  It could add color and animation and a far more vivid display to what we have done.


Things I would like to know more about.
  These charts and how to create them actually could help me with what I was looking to do more of after graduation. I would like to have lots of statistics that are associated visually and this would be a great way of getting the data behind the scenes. Of course I have to get to that point to implement it, but there you go. Just time at the keys. I need to continually push myself to get get familiar with what I have done already and implement it going forward. I need to put in the time, but like I was thinking last night, I spend at least ten hours a day doing nothing but code as it is, taking a break is just as important.
