Class Notes 05


Why this is importannt to me:
  This is all important to me because I am continually building on what I have already began working with and will continue to need to progress in to become more efficient. It isn't necessarily that it is important to remember everything to do, but how to get to where I need to in order to become efficient at the process.


MORE HTML


1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
  A real world use of the alt attribute would be for somebody visually impaired. It will be displayed in place of an image if the image file cannot load.
  
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
  Accessibility of images can be improved by adding effective alt text to the images.
  
3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
  A figure element specifies self contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
  
4. Describe the difference between a git image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
  These are both types of image files. they are used to store images. Jpeg is known as a raster image format. It uses lossy compression algorithms and may lose some of its data. Svg is a text based image format that uses mathematical structures to represent an image and it highly scalable. This means that it can be zoomed in and will still look clear, or zoomed out and will look good. The Jpeg cannot do that. It will get blurry when zoomed in.
  
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
  Jpeg would be ideal to display a screenshot on a website. It would help with loading speeds and is good because of its compression and universal support.
  
  

MORE CSS


1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element. Pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
  The foreground controls what color your brush or pencil would be while the background color erases any added colors and replaces it with the background color.
  
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
  Well, if there is no color I would put in some background color and do some shading on the text, depending on what the site looked like.
  
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
  The main thing to consider would be if both mac and pc users will have the font that you use. So, picking one that is not only easy to read, but that will be easy for others to already have the font downloaded.
4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to html text elements?
  Size of course is the size, determines how big the text is. Weight is the value placed on the font, will determine how bold or light it is, and style is similar to phrase elements, it is used to modify pieces of text. They are stylistic rather than structural.
  
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
  You could either add margin right to the first h1 tag or you could add margin left to the second h1 tag. If you would like to increase the space more, change the value provided.


THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT.

Just how to pace myself through all of this. I think that balance is good, that I can't be all of one way or it will eventually overwhelm me. I spend a lot of time doing this and I know there is a reason and an end, but I need to learn more about how to balance all of this that I am learning with some sort of life.
