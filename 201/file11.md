Class 11 Notes


Why this is important.
  This is important, and especially this week, coming off of last week, a time that was very difficult because of the amount of what needed to be done. This will help further implement what we have learned and where we might go. 
  
  

Video and Audio Content.

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
  Operatin Lindbergh. Just one of the cool things that happened because of innovations. There was Flash, then Silverlight, then there was JavaScript API.
  
2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element.
  The controls attribute is a boolean attribute, when present it specifies that video controls should be displayed. Src attribute specifies the location of the URL.
  
3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video elemeent?
  Fallback content is content that is to ne used when the external resource cannot be used. Fallback provides an alternative solution during a service request failure.
  
4. Write a very short story where audio and video are characters.
  Once upon a time there was audiuo and as it was sitting there one day along came video and together they changed how people could experience what happens in a two dimensional world that is created by beings in a three dimensional world. They struggled happily ever after...
  
  

A Complete Guide to Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
  Grid is designed for use in more than one dimension. Flexbox is designed for one dimension.
  
2. Grid container, grid item and grid lines are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
  A grid container contains grid items. The two labeled lines are called axes. They intersect at zero values.
  
  

Responsive Images

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
  Having images responsive is important because it helps to deliver optimal file size, the right imae for the reight screen ize, and improves user experience and loading time.
  
2. Define the following img attributes, srcset and sizes. write an example of how they are used.
  Srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between. Size is part of that, but but will be controlled by the srcset.
  
3. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or Js?
  It allows the browser to determine how big the image will be. Css doesn't use as much power as Js. Object-fit would work.


What I would like to know more about

  Doing more of this to become more familiar with the process. Watching the partner power hour yesterday I realize that I have a long way to go, and that is fine, but do I have what needs to be sought out in order to be good at this? Will that just come with time? I am really starting to like what it is that I am understanding now, but I also realize that I have to want to be further along. I have to have a drive that will allow me to advance and keep driving. I am starting to look at it that way.
