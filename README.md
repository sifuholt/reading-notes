# My Reading Journal For CODE FELLOWS 

Hi, my name is Ken and I *love* to read.

Growth mindset means to me that...
  I am alive and aware and that this moment is fleeting/eternal. 

1. I can adapt to any environment that I find myself in.   ~~What have I gotten myself into?~~
2. I never feel like I am at a point where I don't need to evolve.   ~~This is the way it has been and should always be!~~
3. **Am constantly able to grow and learn __and change__**, that experience ***(good or bad)***, is a valuable lesson and nothing to fear.
