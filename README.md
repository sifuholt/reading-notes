# My Reading Journal For Code Fellows

Hi, my name is Ken and I am *really* excited to learn about coding!

This will be part of my journey through this world, one that is completely new to me, but one that I will hopefully share with my family. I am a proud father of two girls. Both my wife and I are veterans and we are happy to live in Oregon. Many of these ideas that I will use for projects will come directly from what we are either trying to learn more about or to be part of in real life, so this website will be about my progress towards that goal, with this.
