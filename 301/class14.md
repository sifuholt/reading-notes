Class 14 Notes

This is important to me because the more I am aware of the better I become. The more we are all aware of the better we all become.

Consider the History

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
  Computers become available in the home.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on compuers growing up?
  Males at least had some experience.
  
  
Ask the question

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
  When everyone understands, but unfortunately when it comes from the leaders it usually works best.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
  That should be obvious. Diversity only makes us stronger.

3. How can a diverse company serve a diverse user base or vice versa??...literally by becoming better. The more the merrier!


Things I want to know more about
  I am still here.
