React Docs - Forms

This is important because it continues to build on what I have learned and pushes in where I can grow.

React Docs and Forms


1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  A component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
  Update. To maintain a clean database.
  
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
  The input event fires when the value element has been changed.
  

The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained


1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
  To perform inline condition checking instead of using if..else statements

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
    if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)

Things I would like to know more about: I still need to do this a lot more. I need to either be around people that really like doing this or get a job grinding through it over and over to get better. I can get it, just need to have it as a daily.
