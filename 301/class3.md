301 class 3 notes

Why this topic matters to me: This is important because it builds on what we have previously been taught and how to change it, make it more efficient.



React Docs

1. What does .map return?
  It returns an iterator that results from applying a transformation function to every item in the original input iterable.
  
2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
  
3. Each list item needs a unique?

4. What is the purpose of a key?



The Spread Operator

1. What is the spread operator?

2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.



How to Pass Functions

1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?

3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?



Things I would like to know more about: I would like to just do this enough to be able to functionally progress. I really like React.
